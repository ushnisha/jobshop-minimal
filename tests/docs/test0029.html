       <h3>Test 0029:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 200 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-05 and 2018-01-06. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.

             <li>The ReleasedWorkOrder is planned for a day earlier than
                 the ideal JIT date for the demand for PART001 and its
                 quantity does not match the demand quantity.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>The solver first uses the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on
               2018-01-06 for a quantity of 200. Since the ReleasedWorkOrder
               does not meet the entire demand quantity, a new TaskPlan for
               PART001-OP20 is created for 70 units to start on 2018-01-06 16:40:00
               and end on 2018-01-07 00:00:00.

           <li>As a result, we need to only plan 70 units of PART001-OP10 to start
               2018-01-06 09:20:00 and end 2018-01-06 16:40:00.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result OP20 for PART002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-04 00:00:00 (the earliest time available on RES003)
               because of the plans for PART001-OP20.  Consequently, OP10 for PART002
               now starts on 2018-01-03 00:00:00.
               
           <li>Note that while RES003 has some available time on 2018-01-06 
               between 00:00:00 and 16:40, that time is not sufficient to plan
               the entire 270 units of PART002-OP20.  The solver does not split
               the required quantity on 270 into two batches; rather it plans for
               the entire 270 units starting even earlier.  This is also a current
               limitation of the solver.  It does not look at the current min/max
               lotsize restrictions and see if a suitable lotsize can be planned in
               any available gap as close to JIT as possible.

             <li>As observed in earlier test plans, PART002 is delivered early
                 since the solver tries to minimize inventory at every stage.

             <li>Note that the solver nets out the ReleasedWorkOrder quantity for
                 PART001-OP20 from the demand before planning the excess 70.
         </ul>
