       <h3>Test 0021:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units (base scenario data
               without any changes).

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first.
               We will see the effect of this in future test plans.

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to FALSE.

           <li>A cycle is created by adding a precedence relationship between
               PART001 OP10 and SHIP.
         </ul>

       <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>A cycle is created by adding an extra record to the task
               precedence table by specifying that PART001-OP10 is preceeded
               by PART001-SHIP.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Cycle is detected as part of the static data validation
               analysis and the program is terminated without attempts to solve.

           <li>The logfile contains the details of the cycle.

         </ul>
