       <h3>Test 0023:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 270 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-05 and 2018-01-06. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.

             <li>Note that the ReleasedWorkOrder runs one day earlier than
                 the JIT date (as in test0022).
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time or early.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 is not planned afresh; instead the solver uses
               the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on 2018-01-06 for the same
               quantity as the demand (270).  As a result, we don't need
               to plan PART001-OP10. Since the ReleasedWorkOrder for PART001-OP20
               is one day earlier than the JIT date, we also ship one day earlier
               and meet the demand one day earlier than due.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result OP20 for PART002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-06. Note that since the WorkOrder for PART001-OP20
               was planned on 2018-01-05, this date is now available for PART002-OP20.
               Consequently, OP10 for PART002 is also planned JIT and starts on 2018-01-05.

             <li>In this case, PART001 demand is delivered early (as a result of matching
                 earlier WIP for PART001-OP20) and PART002 is delivered on time.
         </ul>
