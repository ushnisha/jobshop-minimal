       <h3>Test 0042:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, both of them for the same part,
               PART001, and both due on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for CUST001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for CUST002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               CUST001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 270 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-07 and 2018-01-08. The WIP is specifically
                 assigned to DMD001 (the higher priority order).

             <li>The ReleasedWorkOrder is planned a day later than
                 JIT for the demands in question.

             <li>Both demands are for the same part, PART001
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for DMD001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 for DMD001 is not planned afresh; instead the solver uses
               the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on 2018-01-08 for the same
               quantity as the demand (270).  As a result, we don't need
               to plan PART001-OP10 for DMD001.  However, DMD001 is now met
               one day late.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for DMD002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result PART001-OP20 for DMD002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-06 and end on 2018-01-07.  PART001-OP20 for DMD002
               is planned to start on 2018-01-05 and end on 2018-01-06.

             <li>DMD001 is delivered late since the solver has pegged it to the late WIP
                 while the lower priority DMD002 is satisfied exactly on time! This also
                 is a limitation of the solver.  It plans the higher priority demand first
                 and it uses the WIP for that demand first.  While this behavior might
                 appear wrong, one must reconsider why the planner created a ReleasedWorkOrder
                 for a later date when an earlier plan could be created?  A released workorder
                 implies that prior steps have been completed and material has been released
                 for this work order?  Why also did the planner give us a late start date
                 for this released workorder if the resource were indeed available earlier.

                 We must suspect that the input data is wrong; maybe RES003 is not really available
                 before 2018-01-07, but the CalendarShift data shows availability.

                 When you see strange results and strange input data, you must always think:
                 "Garbage IN - Garbage OUT".
         </ul>
