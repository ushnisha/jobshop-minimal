       <h3>Test 0016:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-09, and both for 270 units.


           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first.
               We will see the effect of this in future test plans.

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.
         </ul>

       <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.

           <li>The demands are due on 2018-01-09 rather than 2018-01-14,
               that is, the demands are due 5 days earlier than in the
               base scenario (test0014).
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied late by 1 day, but at the same time.

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time
               but on different workcenters.  OP-10 for PART001 is planned
               on the primary workcenter, RES001 while OP-10 for PART002
               is planned on RES002, the alternate workcenter.  Similarly,
               OP-20 for PART001 loads RES003 and OP-20 for PART002 loads
               RES004.
              
           <li>This is a reflection on the default preference of the solver
               to plan ASAP on the alternate workcenter rather than to build
               late on the primary workcenter - this reflects the desire of
               the solver to minimize tardiness of demand over the choice of
               primary workcenter (vs. the alternate).
         </ul>
