       <h3>Test 0005:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-15, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to FALSE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>The demand has been moved out by one day, compared to test0001.
                 They are now due on 2018-01-15 rather than 2018-01-14.

             <li>Holidays are introduced on New Years Day, All Sundays, and all
                 Second Saturdays.  In this test case, the relevant dates are:
                 2018-01-01, 2018-01-07, 2018-01-13, 2018-01-14.

             <li>All other working days have 50% efficiency compared to 100%.

         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time 
               on the same workcenters (resulting in workcenter overloads).

           <li>OP-10 and OP-20 now have a lead time of 2 days compared to 1
               because of the efficiency related stretching.

           <li>Note that the shipment operation start similar to test0001
               and the demand is met by 2018-01-14 even though it is due only
               on 2018-01-15. This is because we ship as soon as we complete 
               OP-20 which cannot start on 2018-01-06 and complete on 2018-01-08
               because 2018-01-07 is a holiday.  Therefore OP-20 now needs to
               start on 2018-01-05 and complete on 2018-01-07.

           <li>A perfectly acceptable alternate solution is to start OP-20 on
               2018-01-05, but start the SHIP operation only on 2018-01-08 to
               meet the demand just in time.  However, at this time the solver
               does not support that feature.
         </ul>
