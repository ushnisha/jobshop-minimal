       <h3>Test 0001:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units (base scenario data 
               without any changes).


           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 
               We will see the effect of this in future test plans.

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to FALSE. 
               This means that while workcenter holidays, non-working shifts, 
               and efficiency is taken into considerations, it is possible 
               for the solver to schedule two taskplans at the exact same time 
               (or overlap) on the same Workcenter. This is an infeasible plan, 
               but is useful in many scenarios where we want to see the 
               "JUST IN TIME" plan ignoring all workcenter constraints 
               (or assuming infinite capacity).
         </ul>

       <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>None
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time 
               on the same workcenters (resulting in workcenter overloads).

           <li>Please take some time to go over the following output lines that 
               are printed out. Study the format carefully and understand the 
               different pieces of information that are available to you.

           <li>Demand related data has the priority, due quantity and due date, 
               as well as the planned quantity and planned date.

           <li>TaskPlans have the start/end dates of the TaskPlan; the quantity 
               planned, the demand ID for which the TaskPlan is created; 
               the Plan model under which it is planned; and finally, 
               the Workcenter that it loads (if any).

           <li>Note that while PART001-OP10 and PART002-OP10 load RES001, and 
               PART001-OP20 and PART002-OP20 load RES003, the SHIP operations 
               do not load any Workcenter (depicted as loading "null").

           <li>The Workcenter Plans view of the TaskPlans splits out the
               different TaskPlans by the Workcenters that they load.
               As a result we (1) Don't see the SHIP Tasks in this view;
               and (2) We can observe that RES002 is not loaded.

         </ul>

         The output format may be a little strange/difficult to read and get 
         used to, but once you familiarize yourself with it, following through 
         the different test variations and understanding how the planning 
         algorithm accounts for different constraints becomes very easy to 
         follow/understand.
