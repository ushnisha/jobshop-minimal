       <h3>Test 0006:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-08, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to FALSE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>The demand has been moved in by 6 days, compared to test0001.
                 They are now due on 2018-01-08 rather than 2018-01-14.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied late - they are fulfilled on
               2018-01-10 - 2 days late.

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time 
               on the same workcenters (resulting in workcenter overloads).

           <li>The earliest possible start date for OP10 is 2018-01-01 (which
               is the start of the planning horizon).  Consequently, the earliest
               possible start date for OP20 is 2018-01-02.  And the SHIP task can
               start at the earliest on 2018-01-03 and end on 2018-01-10.

           <li>The point to note through this test is that the start of the planning
               horizon (2018-01-01 in this case) is a "hard constraint".  That is,
               under no circumstances will the solver create a taskplan that starts
               prior to the start of the planning horizon.

           <li>It must be noted at this time, that there is no such constraint on the
               end of the planning horizon.  That is, it is possible that the solver
               can schedule a task to start (or end) after the end of the planning
               horizon.  This just means that there is insufficient workcenter
               availability to plan the tasks within the planning horizon.

           <li>One of the implications of the above two points is that it is
               necessary for the users of this application to create a sufficiently
               long planning horizon and to ensure that the workcenters have sufficient
               working capacity to schedule all of the demand within the planning horizon.

           <li>There is an implicit assumption that all demand will always be planned
               and plannable within the planning horizon - demand will not be shorted.

           <li>If the data is such that it is not possible to schedule all demand within
               the planning horizon (or at least at some point in time) then the
               behavior of the solver is not defined.  It may go into an infinite loop
               searching for workcenter availability.
         </ul>
