       <h3>Test 0020:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-09, and both for 270 units.


           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first.
               We will see the effect of this in future test plans.

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.
         </ul>

       <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.

           <li>The demands are due on 2018-01-09 rather than 2018-01-14,
               that is, the demands are due 5 days earlier than in the
               base scenario (test0014).

           <li>The priority for all records in the taskworkcenterassn file
               is set to 1.  That is, all the workcenters are "primary".
               This means that the solver is free to choose either
               workcenter to plan the task on, as it sees fit
               (including arbitrarily). It is useful to compare this test
               to test0016 since this is the only difference between this
               test and test0016 (workcenter priorities).
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied late by 1 day, but at the same time.

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time
               but on different workcenters.  OP-10 for PART001 is planned
               on the one of the workcenters, RES001/RES002 while OP-10 for
               PART002 is planned on the other workcenter.  Similarly,
               OP-20 for PART001 loads one of RES003/RES004 and OP-20 for
               PART002 loads the other workcenter.
              
           <li>The effect of this behavior is that the testplan can have alternate
               optimal results (4 possible combinations).

           <li>Refer to github issue #32 for more information on the motivation
               behind the creation of this test plan.

           <li>At this point, this test *may* fail depending on the solution
               generated by the solver at any given day/time.  In the future,
               we will enhance the regression testing script to check against
               multiple expect files and pass the test if even one of these
               expect files matches.
         </ul>
