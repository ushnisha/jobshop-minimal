       <h3>Test 0018:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units (base scenario data
               without any changes).

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first.
               We will see the effect of this in future test plans.

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.
         </ul>

       <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.

           <li>RES004 has a dedicated efficiency calendar, which is almost
               identical to the default efficiency calendar, except that
               it also has a holiday on 2018-01-06.

           <li>RES003 has a dedicated efficiency calendar, which is almost
               identical to the default efficiency calendar, except that
               it also has a holiday on 2018-01-05.

           <li>This test case is very similar to test0017, but we have an
               additional twist where building ahead to 2018-01-05 on RES003
               is not possible because it is a holiday for RES003.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time (one is satisfied early)

           <li>The planning logic is explained below.

           <li>First, we plan the demand for PART001 just in time and this
               results in PART001-SHIP planned to start on 2018-01-07 and
               meet the demand just in time on 2018-01-14.

           <li>PART001-OP20 is planned to start on 2018-01-06 00:00:00 and
               loads workcenter RES003 (as in test0015).

           <li>PART001-OP10 is planned to start on 2018-01-05 00:00:00 and
               loads workcenter RES001 (as in test0015).

           <li>Now we plan the demand for PART002, and PART002-SHIP is planned
               to start on 2018-01-07 (just like in test0017).  However, at
               this point, things change.
 
           <li>Ideally, a JIT plan would require that PART002-OP20 be planned
               on RES004 (since RES003 is loaded by PART001-OP20).  However,
               RES004 is not available on 2018-01-06 (due to its workcenter
               having no availability on that day - the specific variation in
               this dataset from test0015).  So, we need to plan PART002-OP20
               to start on 2018-01-05.  Ideally we would switch back to the
               primary workcenter, RES003, but since RES003 is no longer available
               on 2018-01-05, we switch to the alternate RES004.

           <li>PART002-OP10 needs to start on 2018-01-04, and we now plan it on
               its primary workcenter, RES001, since we have already built ahead
               for PART002-OP20.

           <li>The combination of test0017 and test0018 demonstrate how the solver
               has the following default preferences:<br/>
               (1) Try to minimize tardiness, even if that means using alternate
                   workcenter<br/>
               (2) Build as close to JIT as possible, even if that means using
                   alternate workcenters. <br/>
               (3) When it is possible to build on either the primary on alternate
                   workcenter given the constraints of (1) and (2) above, always
                   prefer to build on the primary workcenter.<br/>

           <li>As a side effect of building earlier by one day, we also end up
               shipping the PART002 demand one day earlier, and the planned date
               for PART002-DMD002 is now 2018-01-13 (one day early).
         </ul>
