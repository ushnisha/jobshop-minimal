       <h3>Test 0010:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>This is the first testplan to consider workcenter availability
                 as a "hard constraint".  This is reflected in the setting of
                 the planning parameter RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED to TRUE.

             <li>The only difference between the base scenario in test0001 and
                 this test is the setting of the RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED parameter.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working through
               the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand and is
               planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to complete on time.
               As a result OP20 for PART001 is planned to start on 2018-01-06.
               OP10 for PART001 is planned to start on 2018-01-05.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result OP20 for PART002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-05 - note that this is a day earlier than OP20
               for PART001 - this is because RES003 is already reserved for OP20
               of PART001 on 2018-01-06 (the ideal just in time date for OP20).
               Consequently, OP10 for PART002 is also pulled in earlier by one day
               and now starts on 2018-01-04. 

             <li>An interesting point to note is that the demand for PART002 is shown
                 as being delivered early.  This is because OP10 and OP20 for
                 PART002 are being "built ahead" - earlier than their "just in time"
                 planning dates because of workcenter availability constraints.
                 As a result, the PART002 sku is available for shipping earlier than
                 required - and the solver currently ships it as soon as the material
                 is available.

             <li>A perfectly acceptable solution is to "build ahead" OP10 and OP20
                 for PART002, but to still SHIP PART002 out only on 2018-01-07 to
                 meet the demand exactly in time.  However, the solver does not
                 support this behaviour currently.
         </ul>
