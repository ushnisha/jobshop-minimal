       <h3>Test 0038:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, both of them for the same part,
               PART001, and both due on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for CUST001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for CUST002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               CUST001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 200 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-05 and 2018-01-06. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.

             <li>Both demands are for the same part, PART001
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for DMD001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 for DMD001 first uses the ReleasedWorkOrder for 200
               units completing on 2018-01-06. The remaining 70 units are planned
               to start 2018-01-06 16:40:00 and end 2018-01-07 00:00:00.
               PART001-OP10 for DMD001 is planned for 70 units starting
               2018-01-06 09:20:00 and ending 2018-01-06 16:40:00. 

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for DMD002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  It is planned at the earliest availability
               on RES003 prior to 2018-01-07 which is 2018-01-04 00:00:00.
               PART001-OP20 for DMD002 start 2018-01-04 00:00:00 and ends 2018-01-05 00:00:00.
               PART001-OP10 for DMD002 is planned for 270 units to start on
               2018-01-03 00:00:00 and ends 2018-01-04 00:00:00.

           <li>Note that there is a pocket of availability on 2018-01-06 between
               00:00:00 and 16:40:00, but that time is not sufficient to build the entire
               270 units for PART001-OP20 for DMD002.  At this time, the solver does
               not support min/max lotsizing constraints and plans full quantities; it
               is unable to split up the 270 units into smaller pieces that can use
               this available capacity.

         </ul>
