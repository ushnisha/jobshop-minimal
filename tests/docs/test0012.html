       <h3>Test 0012:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-09, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.

             <li>Demands are due 5 days earlier, on 2018-01-09.

             <li>Holidays are introduced on New Years Day, All Sundays, and all
                 Second Saturdays.  In this test case, the relevant dates are:
                 2018-01-01, 2018-01-07, 2018-01-13, 2018-01-14.

             <li>All other working days continue to have 100% efficiency.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied late.  The demand for PART001 is satisfied
               on 2018-01-11 - 2 days late while the demand for PART002 is satisfied
               on 2018-01-12 - 3 days late.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working through
               the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand and is
               planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-02 to complete on time.
               As a result OP20 for PART001 is required to start on 2018-01-01.
               Howvever, since 2018-01-01 is a holiday, OP20 can start at the
               earliest on 2018-01-02.  This in turn requires OP10 to now start on
               2018-01-01 - which is a holiday.  As a result, OP10 is now pushed out
               to start on 2018-01-02.  Note that OP10 will load the primary workcenter,
               RES001.  Consequently, OP20 must now start on 2018-01-03, and SHIP 
               task for PART001 start on 2018-01-04.  The demand for PART001 is 
               met on 2018-01-11, 2 days late.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-02
               to complete just in time.  As a result OP20 for PART002 is required
               to start on 2018-01-01; since this is a holiday, OP20 can start on
               2018-01-02 at the earliest.  This means OP10 for PART002 is now
               required to start on 2018-01-01; since this is a holiday, OP10 is
               pushed out to start on 2018-01-02.  However, OP10 for PART002 cannot
               run on workcenter RES001 since it is already used by OP10 for PART001.
               Therefore OP10 for PART002 is shifted to RES002, the alternate
               workcenter.  Consequently, OP20 for PART002 can only start on 208-01-03
               at the earliest.  However, since OP20 for both parts share the same
               workcenter, RES003, both of them cannot run at the same time.  Therefore
               OP20 for PART002 is even further pushed out to start on 2018-01-04.
               The SHIP task for PART002 starts on 2018-01-05 and the demand for PART002
               is met on 2018-01-12 - 3 days late.

           <li>It is interesting to note how the current solver logic results in a
               suboptimal plan for PART002.  We switched its OP10 to run on the alternate
               workcenter RES002 to start as early as possible and minimize the delay in
               satisfying the demand.  However, because OP20's shared a constrained
               workcenter RES003, OP20 for PART002 could not start as soon as OP10 had
               completed.  We might have as well scheduled OP10 for PART002 on RES001
               to start on 2018-01-03 (when it is available) and planned both parts on
               their primary workcenter choices.

           <li>In both cases, the demand would have the same lateness, but the choice of
               workcenters would have been different.  At this time, the solver is 
               unable to switch back to the primary resource for OP10 for PART002.
               This will (hopefully) be addressed as we enhance the solver.
         </ul>
