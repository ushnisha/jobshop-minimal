       <h3>Test 0007:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-09, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to FALSE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>The demand has been moved in by 5 days, compared to test0001.
                 They are now due on 2018-01-09 rather than 2018-01-14.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied late - they are fulfilled on
               2018-01-10 - 1 day late.

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time 
               on the same workcenters (resulting in workcenter overloads).

           <li>The earliest possible start date for OP10 is 2018-01-01 (which
               is the start of the planning horizon).  Consequently, the earliest
               possible start date for OP20 is 2018-01-02.  And the SHIP task can
               start at the earliest on 2018-01-03 and end on 2018-01-10.

             <li>The aim of this test is to show that moving the demand to any 
                 date prior to 2018-01-10 will result in the same plan.  The
                 only difference between test0007 (this test) and 
                 test0006 (prior test) is that the due dates differ by one day,
                 but since both due dates are before 2018-01-10, the resulting
                 plans are identical.
         </ul>
