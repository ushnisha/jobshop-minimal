       <h3>Test 0019:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part.  The demand
               for PART001 is for 846 and is due on 2018-01-15.  The demand
               for PART002 is for 270 and is due on 2018-01-14.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>The demand quanitty for PART001 is increased to 846 and it is
                 due one day later, 2018-01-15.
                 
             <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.

             <li>Please check github issue #31 to understand the motivation for
                 this test plan.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>Since PART001 demand has a higher quantity (846) its lead time
               is now 3 days. This changes the planning logic.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-08
               to complete on time. As a result OP20 for PART001 is planned
               to load RES003 and starts on 2018-01-05 and ends on 2018-01-08.
               OP10 for PART001 is planned to start on 2018-01-02 and loads
               RES001, the primary workcenter for PART001-OP10.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on
               2018-01-07 to complete just in time. As a result OP20 for
               PART002 is required to start on 2018-01-06 for a JIT plan
               and load RES003 (the single shared workcenter for PART001 and
               PART002 OP20's).  However, since PART001-OP20 is already 
               planned in this period, we build ahead and start on 2018-01-04.

           <li>Consequently, OP10 for PART002 needs to start on 2018-01-03 to
               complete by 2018-01-04.  Since this time is not available on
               the primary workcenter RES001, we plan PART002-OP10 on RES002
               on these dates.

           <li>While this seems to be just another case of constrained planning
               that must already be covered with other test cases, it is not;
               a specific corner case described in github issue #31 happens in
               this case where the JIT plan for PART002-OP20 falls completely
               within the JIT plan for PART001-OP20. A bug in the code failed
               to take account of this corner case and resulted in both 
               tasks planned JIT on RES003 resulting in
               a workcenter overload violation.
         </ul>
