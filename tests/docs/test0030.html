       <h3>Test 0030:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 200 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-07 and 2018-01-08. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.

             <li>The ReleasedWorkOrder is planned for a day later than
                 the ideal JIT date for the demand for PART001 and its
                 quantity does not match the demand quantity.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>The demand for PART001 is satisfied late and the demand for
               PART002 is satisfied early.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>The solver first uses the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on
               2018-01-08 for a quantity of 200. Since the ReleasedWorkOrder
               does not meet the entire demand quantity, a new TaskPlan for
               PART001-OP20 is created for 70 units to start on 2018-01-06 16:40:00
               and end on 2018-01-07 00:00:00.

           <li>As a result, we need to only plan 70 units of PART001-OP10 to start
               2018-01-06 09:20:00 and end 2018-01-06 16:40:00.

           <li>However, the demand for PART001 is satisfied only on 2018-01-15 (one
               day late) because the ReleasedWorkOrder is one day late from the ideal
               JIT date.  The default behavior of the solver is to always use WIP
               first, even at the cost of delaying demand.  The remaining quantity,
               however, is planned JIT.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result OP20 for PART002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-05 16:40:00 (the earliest time available on RES003)
               because of the plans for PART001-OP20.  Consequently, OP10 for PART002
               now starts on 2018-01-04 16:40:00.

             <li>As observed in earlier test plans, PART002 is delivered early
                 since the solver tries to minimize inventory at every stage.
         </ul>
