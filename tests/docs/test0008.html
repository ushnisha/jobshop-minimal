       <h3>Test 0008:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-09, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to FALSE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>The demand has been moved in by 5 days, compared to test0001.
                 They are now due on 2018-01-09 rather than 2018-01-14.

             <li>Holidays are introduced on New Years Day, All Sundays, and all
                 Second Saturdays.  In this test case, the relevant dates are:
                 2018-01-01, 2018-01-07, 2018-01-13, 2018-01-14.

             <li>All other working days continue to have 100% efficiency.

             <li>In effect, this is test0007 + holidays.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied late - they are fulfilled on
               2018-01-11 - 2 day late.

           <li>We schedule OP-10 and OP-20 for both parts at the same time 
               on the same workcenters (resulting in workcenter overloads).

           <li>The earliest possible start date for OP10 is 2018-01-02. Note
               that OP10 can no longer start on 2018-01-01 which is a holiday.
               Consequently, the earliest possible start date for OP20 is 
               2018-01-03.  And the SHIP task can start at the earliest on 
               2018-01-04 and end on 2018-01-11.

             <li>This test builds on test0007 to show the combined effects of
                 the planning horizon and holidays that together result in
                 delay of demand.
         </ul>
