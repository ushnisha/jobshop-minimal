       <h3>Test 0025:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 300 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-06 and 2018-01-07. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for PART001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 is not planned afresh; instead the solver uses
               the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on 2018-01-07 for a quantity
               of 300. Since the ReleasedWorkOrder is not dedicated to a specific
               demandID, the solver splits the WIP into two lots; one for 270
               that is now pegged to DMD001 (for PART001) and another lot for
               the remaining 30 units that is not associated with any demandID.
               As a result, we don't need to plan PART001-OP10. Since the
               ReleasedWorkOrder for PART001-OP20 is on the exact same date and
               quantity as required for JIT planning the demand for PART001 is
               met on time.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for PART002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result OP20 for PART002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-05 - note that this is a day earlier than OP20
               for PART001 - this is because RES003 is already reserved for OP20
               of PART001 on 2018-01-06 (the ReleasedWorkOrder for this Task).
               Consequently, OP10 for PART002 is also pulled in earlier by one day
               and now starts on 2018-01-04. 

             <li>As observed in earlier test plans, PART002 is delivered early
                 since the solver tries to minimize inventory at every stage.

             <li>Also note, that we now have two lots of the ReleasedWorkOrder for
                 two different quantities, 30 and 270, but stretching over RES003
                 for the same duration of 1 day.  ReleasedWorkOrders consume capacity
                 but can overlap with each other since they are user specified
                 overrides.  There is still only one WorkOrder on the shop floor;
                 the two lots are simply a way for the solver to assign some amount
                 of that workorder to one demand and keep the remaing quantity
                 available for some other demand.  We will see this behavior in
                 a later test case.
