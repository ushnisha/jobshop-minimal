       <h3>Test 0017:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, one for each part, both due 
               on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units (base scenario data
               without any changes).

           <li>The demand for PART001 has a priority of 1, while the demand
               for PART002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for
               PART001 has a higher priority and is planned first.
               We will see the effect of this in future test plans.

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.
         </ul>

       <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE.

           <li>RES004 has a dedicated efficiency calendar, which is almost
               identical to the default efficiency calendar, except that
               it also has a holiday on 2018-01-06. This test case is very
               similar to test0015, but since a JIT plan will require
               planning OP20 on 2018-01-06, we see how the solver behaves
               when one of the workcenters is not available on this day.
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time (one is satisfied early)

           <li>We schedule OP10 and OP20 for both parts at different times
               but on the same workcenters. The planning logic is explaned
               below.

           <li>First, we plan the demand for PART001 just in time and this
               results in PART001-SHIP planned to start on 2018-01-07 and
               meet the demand just in time on 2018-01-14.

           <li>PART001-OP20 is planned to start on 2018-01-06 00:00:00 and
               loads workcenter RES003 (as in test0015).

           <li>PART001-OP10 is planned to start on 2018-01-05 00:00:00 and
               loads workcenter RES001 (as in test0015).

           <li>Now we plan the demand for PART002, and PART002-SHIP is planned
               to start on 2018-01-07 (just like in test0015).  However, at
               this point, things change.
 
           <li>Ideally, a JIT plan would require that PART002-OP20 be planned
               on RES004 (since RES003 is loaded by PART001-OP20).  However,
               RES004 is not available on 2018-01-06 (due to its workcenter
               having no availability on that day - the specific variation in
               this dataset from test0015).  So, we need to plan PART002-OP20
               to start on 2018-01-05.  Since we anyway need to schedule this
               task one day earlier than JIT, we can now switch back to RES003
               since it is the primary workcenter.

           <li>Similarly, now PART002-OP10 needs to start on 2018-01-04, and
               we now plan it on its primary workcenter, RES001.

           <li>Thus, by making just one day (JIT day for PART002-OP20) a holiday
               on RES004, we have cause the solver to build ahead and plan only
               using the primary workcenters.  This is the "correct" result since
               we will have to build ahead whether we use the primary or the
               alternate workcenter for PART002-OP20; and so we switch to using
               the user preferred primary workcenter whenever we can.

           <li>As a side effect of building earlier by one day, we also end up
               shipping the PART002 demand one day earlier, and the planned date
               for PART002-DMD002 is now 2018-01-13 (one day early).
         </ul>
