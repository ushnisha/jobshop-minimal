       <h3>Test 0045:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, both of them for the same part,
               PART001, and both due on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for CUST001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for CUST002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               CUST001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>There are two ReleasedWorkOrders for PART001-OP20 in this test.
                 One ReleasedWorkOrder of 300 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-06 and 2018-01-07. It is specifically
                 assigned to DMD002, the lower priority demand.
                 The second ReleasedWorkOrder of 100 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-05 and 2018-01-06.  It is also specifically
                 assigned to DMD002, the lower priority demand.

             <li>Both demands are for the same part, PART001
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for DMD001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 for DMD001 is planned afresh since the WIP is
               specifically meant for DMD002.  So, we now plan PART001-OP20
               for DMD001 to start 2018-01-04 and complete 2018-01-05.  We
               then plan PART001-OP10 for DMD001 to start 2018-01-03 and to
               complete 2018-01-04.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for DMD002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  PART001-OP20 for DMD002 can use the WIP
               for 300 available on 2018-01-06 to 2018-01-07 and it is planned
               exactly on time (JIT).  There is no need to create any plan for
               PART001-OP10 for DMD002.

           <li>Notice that since the ReleasedWorkOrder was assigned to
               DMD002, the higher priority demand cannot consume from it and has to
               be planned in full (and early) while the lower priority demand uses up
               the WIP when it is planned.

           <li>Another highlight of this test is that the assignment of WIP
               to a demand is not only effective when there is a question of splitting
               a ReleasedWorkOrder into lots; but even when there is a standalone
               ReleasedWorkOrder that will completely go to waste, like the second
               ReleasedWorkOrder for 100 units pegged to DMD002. 
         </ul>
