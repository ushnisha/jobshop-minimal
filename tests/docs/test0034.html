       <h3>Test 0034:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, both of them for the same part,
               PART001, and both due on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for CUST001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for CUST002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               CUST001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 300 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-06 and 2018-01-07. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.

             <li>Both demands are for the same part, PART001
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for DMD001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 for DMD001 is not planned afresh; instead the solver uses
               the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on 2018-01-07. It uses up
               270 units of the ReleasedWorkOrder only and splits off another lot
               of 30 units that is left unassigned for the time being.
               As a result, we don't need to plan PART001-OP10 for DMD001.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for DMD002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  Since there is now 30 units of unassigned
               quantity of the ReleasedWorkOrder still available, we first use that up
               and the remaining 240 units are planned for PART001-OP20 for DMD002. This
               task start on 2018-01-05 02:30:00 and complete 2018-01-06 00:00:00.
               PART001-OP10 for DMD2 is planned for 240 units to start on
               2018-01-04 05:00:00 and ends 2018-01-05 02:30:00.

           <li>Notice that since the original ReleasedWorkOrder was not assigned to
               any specific demandID, the higher priority demand consumed from it and
               the net available quantity was now available for consumption of the lower
               priority demand for the same part.
         </ul>
