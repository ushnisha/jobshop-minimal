       <h3>Test 0032:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>This test has the two demands, both of them for the same part,
               PART001, and both due on 2018-01-14, and both for 270 units.

           <li>The demand for CUST001 has a priority of 1, while the demand 
               for CUST002 has a priority of 2. That is, the demand for 
               CUST001 has a higher priority and is planned first. 

           <li>The RESOURCE_CONSTRAINED planning parameter is set to TRUE. 
         </ul>

         <h3>Variations from the Base Scenario:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Workcenter availability is a "hard constraint".

             <li>A ReleasedWorkOrder of 270 units for PART001-OP20 loads
                 RES003 between 2018-01-05 and 2018-01-06. It is not
                 assigned to any specific demandID.

             <li>The ReleasedWorkOrder is planned a day earlier than
                 JIT for the demands in question.

             <li>Both demands are for the same part, PART001
         </ul>

         <h3>The expected result is as follows:</h3>

         <ul>
           <li>Both demands are satisfied on time.

           <li>We can follow the constrained planning logic of by working
               through the steps of planning the demands, one at a time.

           <li>First we plan the SHIP for DMD001 (higher priority demand
               and is planned first).  It needs to start on 2018-01-07 to
               complete on time.  

           <li>PART001-OP20 for DMD001 is not planned afresh; instead the solver uses
               the ReleasedWorkOrder completing on 2018-01-05 for the same
               quantity as the demand (270).  As a result, we don't need
               to plan PART001-OP10 for DMD001.

           <li>Next we plan the SHIP for DMD002.  It needs to start on 2018-01-07
               to complete just in time.  As a result PART001-OP20 for DMD002 is planned
               to start on 2018-01-06 and end on 2018-01-07.  PART001-OP20 for DMD002
               is planned to start on 2018-01-05 and end on 2018-01-06.

             <li>DMD001 is delivered early since the solver tries to minimize
                 inventory at every stage while DMD002 is satisfied exactly on time.
         </ul>
